# JBA - Easy Rider Company

Project from JetBrains Academy: `Easy Rider Company`

Exercises: `level 4`

## Objectives:

1. The string containing the data in JSON format is passed to standard input.
2. Check that the data types match.
3. Check that the required fields are filled in.
4. Display the information about the number of found errors in total and in
   each field.

   `(i)` Keep in mind that there might be no errors at all.
5. The output should have the same formatting as shown in the example.

If you can't find the necessary information in the stage description, it can
probably be found in the attached documentation.

Note that the time format is military time (24 hours, hh:mm). That means that
there are certain restrictions:

- the first digit cannot be 3, 4, etc.;
- hours less than 10 should have zero in front of them, e.g. 08:34;
- the delimiter should be colon :.
