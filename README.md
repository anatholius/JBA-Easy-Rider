# JBA - Easy Rider Company

Project from JetBrains Academy: `Easy Rider Company`

Exercises: `level 4`

## Objectives:

1. The string containing the data in JSON format is passed to standard input.
2. Make sure each bus line has exactly one starting point (S) and one final
   stop (F).
3. If a bus line does not meet this condition, stop checking and print a
   message about it. Do not continue checking the other bus lines.
4. If all bus lines meet the condition, count how many starting points and
   final stops there are. Print their unique names in alphabetical order.
5. Count the transfer stops and print their unique names in alphabetical order.
   A transfer stop is a stop shared by at least two bus lines.
6. The output should have the same formatting as shown in the example.

If you can't find the necessary information in the stage description, it can
probably be found in the attached documentation.
